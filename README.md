# UniversityVisualizaitonD3
by Paul Glenn and Shir Nehma

This is a mid-semester project for the Information Visualization course at the UC Berkeley School of Information, taught by Prof. Marti Hearst.

The assignment was to visualize data from Kaggle's [World University Rankings](https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/world-university-rankings) dataset using both a parallel coordinates chart and a radar chart.

Our take on the assignment differed from other groups in that we chose to integrate both charts into a single visualization with controls that not only chose which universities to include in the radar chart but also highlighted those universities in the parallel coordinates.

A full write-up of the implementation is available as a PDF in this repository, and a live demo is available [here](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~paul.glenn/i247s16/
).
